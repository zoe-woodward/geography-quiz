# Geography Quiz
## A quiz on US states and world capitals 

![Game launch page](./assets/Game-screenshot.png)

In this game, players can choose to answer questions about US States or World Capitals. 10 correct answers in a row means victory; but a single mistake means defeat. 

The inspiration for the game is a personal desire to perform better in a weekly pub quiz; of which geography questions consistently form part of the team's downfall!

The quiz game utilizes two arrays of questions, shuffling them each time the quiz resets to make sure players aren't being consistently asked the same thing. Each question has four possible multiple choice answers and if the player selects the right answer, they move on to a new question. Sound effects are utilised to enhance the gaming experience by reinforcing the win/loss outcomes.
