## A quiz on US states and world capitals 

In this game, players can choose to answer questions on US States or World Capitals. 10 correct answers in a row means victory; but a single mistake means defeat. 

The inspiration for the game is a personal desire to perform better in a weekly pub quiz; of which geography questions consistently form part of the team's downfall!
